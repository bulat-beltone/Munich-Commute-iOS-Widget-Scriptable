I'm not a developer

Help me to do stuff, run terminal command if you suggests them

In "ai-chat-history.md" describe you understanding of current task. If task switches, add new one. Update with every message. Try to be concise, add only important details. Add date as well. Read it before starting to get context. Don't just add new text, read the file first, check the topics, and then add new changes with current date to the topic. Keep file organised by topics first, then dates. Don't hesitate to move things around to organize it better.

Before doing any my command, answer the question:
Is it a good idea to do that? If not, what to do instead, better?
Will it break any existing functionality?
How main user flow will change?
